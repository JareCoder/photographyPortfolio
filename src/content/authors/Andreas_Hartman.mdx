## About me

> <small>If you are interested in my photography or about the person behind the photography, feel free to send me a message on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/andreashartman/). I am always interested in meeting new people.</small>

To me photography is about showing appreciation and gratitude for the beauty we have around us; nature, people, special moments and incredible feats. All of God’s creations that I have the privilege of capturing with my own unique perspective.

I'm grateful for having amazing people in my life and therefore love to show them off in the way that I view them. I truly believe that if people could see how others view them, they would have more confidence to embrace their individuality. That being said, I love to enhance people’s confidence with my photography.

## The start of my photography journey

> <small> My educational background is in Hotel Management, followed by Creative Business. Photography is not something that I have studied, it was a hobby that got out of hand. </small>

As a kid my parents noticed how I would focus on details rather than just focusing on the obvious. Especially during our road trips through Europe. Eventually when I was around 11 years-old my parents gave me my first point-and-shoot camera. This camera got upgraded a few times to keep up with my development.

Ultimately, phones contained decent cameras, they surpassed most point-and-shoot devices. Taking snapshots of everyday life was just as common as it is today. With this innovation I did not pursue photography actively anymore. This would change later when I entered high school.

While in high school I worked on a film project with a friend, after which we got nominated for the Dutch Film Festival for high-school students. At the festival I had my first hands-on experience with a DSLR camera. I started asking questions and inquired about average prices. After which I was stunned at the price, thinking I would not achieve this dream anytime soon.

Ever since that festival I decided that I would make my dream of owning a DSLR camera happen. For that reason, I decided to start a newspaper route 6 days a week in the mornings before going to school. I kept this up for two years and was able to buy my first beginner DSLR in 2015, a Canon EOS 100D. From then on, I got a lot of practice by inviting friends to photoshoots. This led to my first magazine published picture in 2017 as well as my first paid photoshoot.

Once I entered my second year of Hotel Management school I upgraded to my first full-frame DSLR, A second-hand Canon EOS 6D. A few lenses and years later, I invested in my first mirrorless full frame, a Canon EOS RP. By creating lots of great memories with amazing people, I have been able to develop my own style, and practice what I love doing.
