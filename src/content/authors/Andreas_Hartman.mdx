## About me

> <small>If you are interested in my photography or about the person behind the photography, feel free to send me a message on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/andreashartman/). I am always interested in meeting new people.</small>

To me photography is about showing appreciation and gratitude for the beauty we have around us; nature, people, special moments and incredible feats. All of God’s creations that I have the privilege of capturing with my own unique perspective.

I'm grateful for having amazing people in my life and therefore love to show them off in the way that I view them. I truly believe that if people could see how others view them, they would have more confidence to embrace their individuality. That being said, I love to enhance people’s confidence with my photography.

## The start of my photography journey

> <small> My educational background is in Hotel Management, followed by Creative Business. Photography is not something that I have studied, it was a hobby that got out of hand. </small>

As a child I was always obsessed with focusing on details rather than the obvious. My parents noticed this and set me up with a small point-and-shoot camera. Years later this switched to a phone.

Fast forward a few years and I find myself nominated for the Dutch Film Festival for high schoolers, after shooting a video project with a friend. This festival is where I first put my hands on a DSLR. At that moment I decided that I would buy one, until the price tag shattered my expectations.

This led to me delivering the morning newspaper every day before school started. I would get up at 4 AM for 6 days a week for 2 years straight. After which I was able to buy my first DSLR camera, a Canon 100D.

From then on, I practiced a lot by inviting friends to photoshoots. This led to my first magazine-published picture in 2017, as well as my first paid photoshoot.

Once I entered my second year of Hotel Management school, I upgraded to my first full-frame DSLR; a second-hand Canon 6D. A few years and lenses later, I invested in my first mirrorless full frame camera; a Canon RP. Using this camera, I have been able to make lots of great memories with amazing people. This has led to the development of my own unique style, that I enjoy shooting.
