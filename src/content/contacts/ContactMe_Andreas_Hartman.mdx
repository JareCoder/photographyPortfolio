## Contact Me

> <small>If you are interested in my photography or about the person behind the photography, feel free to send me a message on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/andreashartman/). I am always interested in meeting new people.</small>

To me photography is about showing appreciation and gratitude for the beauty we have around us; nature, people, special moments and incredible feats. All of God’s creations that I have the privilege of capturing with my own unique perspective.

I'm grateful for having amazing people in my life and therefore love to show them off in the way that I view them. I truly believe that if people could see how others view them, they would have more confidence to embrace their individuality. That being said, I love to enhance people’s confidence with my photography.
