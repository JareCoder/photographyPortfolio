A degree of separation. Also serendipitously met. Varied, raw individual, with a youthful splendor. Despite having only met for a few moments, she was keen on getting her portraits taken. The ease of the whole process has got me thinking about the irrationality behind the fear of the unknown. But you can never really know till you have taken the plunge.
