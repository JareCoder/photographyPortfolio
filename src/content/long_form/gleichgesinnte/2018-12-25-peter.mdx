We talked about his project which consisted of photographers all over the world, and now he is on mine. During the short amount of time that we met, not to say the least that it is the quality of the time spent, and not the quantity of which.

His unique perspective as a designer comes through in his photographs. One of the things that I like to think about - there is no useless information, anything and everything can be used in another form, like energy. Cannot be created, can only be converted.
