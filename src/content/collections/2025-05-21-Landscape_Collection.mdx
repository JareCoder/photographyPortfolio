Cinematic Noir Collection, a collection of images inspired by the film noir genre, featuring dramatic lighting and moody atmospheres.
My very first dedicated collection, and the style of photography that I am most passionate about. 
Searching for light sources, in the night is a game in itself. Challenging myself in harsh lighting conditions whilst utilizing my environment is a great way to learn and grow as a photographer.
In turn, it gives dramatic results that I am very proud of.
